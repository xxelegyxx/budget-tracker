## :newspaper: Description:
This application uses MongoDB, Node, and Express to allow users to track their budget. Users can add financial transactions and distinguish if their budget was added to or removed from. A list of transactions will accumulate on the page!

## :newspaper: Installation:
To run locally, the user should fork this repo and set up a database called "budget_db" using Mongodb. From here, the user can run npm i, mongod, and npm start to run the server and view and use the app. From there open localhost on your browser of choice to test the app!

## :floppy_disk: Usage:
* User can add transactions while adding or subtracting money to see a great visualisation of budget and spending
* The UI updates as user submits transactions
